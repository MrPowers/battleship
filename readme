Make a battleship game that can be played by two humans.
Finish a version one that is tested.
After a working version is created, add more tests and refactor the code.  Try to separate the concerns and eliminate unnecessary dependencies.


Make a battleship game using object oriented code

Basics of the game
  each player sets their ships
  players alternate turns
  	there is either a hit or a miss each turn
  	a board that keeps track of the hits and misses will be printed every turn
  The game continues until one player has all their ships sunk


Ship class
  ships will know their position
  ships will know their type
  ships will know where they have been hit


Board class
  board will be a 2 X 2 grid
  

Player class
	each player will have a name


Main class
  Will have a go method that runs the program
